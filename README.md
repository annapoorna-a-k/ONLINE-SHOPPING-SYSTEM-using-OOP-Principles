# Online-Shopping-System
This is a small scale project for Online shopping system. The basic idea is that customers can buy products using online websites. The user can enter the name and password and can create an account and then purchase products.<br>
The Online Shopping system enables customers to browse through the items/products and a system administrator to approve and maintain lists of products. Also on the agenda is designing an online shopping site to manage the items in the shop and also help customers purchase them online without having to visit the shop physically.
